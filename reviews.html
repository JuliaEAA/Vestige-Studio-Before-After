        <p>She was absolutely amazing my hair has never looked better! âœ¨ I still don't believe this is my hair! You can really tell she loves what she does, and it shows! Super customer-friendly, reasonably priced ðŸ‘Œ The only thing I'm sad about is that I can only give here 5 stars here! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ</p>

        <p>Diana is a magician! ðŸ’– Vestige Studio is where vision meets skill. Diana will save your hair from anything. ðŸ’¯ recommended!</p>

        <p>Diana is the best. I was about to change my hair color because I thought it's not for me, but she made me fall in love with blond again (just before my wedding ðŸ¥¹). I'll be back!!</p>

      <div class="review">
        <p>I had such a lovely experience at this salon! I came in for a haircut and hair color, and I left not only extremely happy with the result, but also with a deep appreciation for the care and professionalism I received. Diana was warm, honest, and truly passionate about what she does. She didn't just aim to make my hair look good â€” she genuinely cared about its health. She gave me great advice tailored to my hair type, explained everything clearly, and made sure I felt confident and comfortable the entire time. It's rare to find someone who combines skill, heart, and knowledge so naturally. I'm incredibly happy with the result, and I highly recommend Diana to anyone looking for both beauty and healthy hair care â€” all in a relaxed and positive atmosphere.</p>

        <p>I cannot recommend Diana at Vestige Studio Salon highly enough! She is truly exceptional when it comes to hair coloring whether it's balayage, babylights, or any other technique, she masters it. Before finding Diana, I had a disappointing experience at one of the biggest salons in Herning. My hair turned out way too dark, almost black, with harsh white streaks that made me feel really unhappy with my appearance. Diana not only corrected the color beautifully, but she also did it without damaging my hair. Thanks to her, I feel confident and love my hair again. She's incredibly professional, gives thoughtful guidance, and genuinely cares about the health of your hair. I look forward to my next visit. If you're looking for a true expert who delivers amazing results with care and professionalism, Diana is the one. Highly recommended!</p>
